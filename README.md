# Database---GymManagement
Database - Gym management System - Java Project

As part of our database course project, we adapted an existing application to support and operate with a database system instead of relying on arrays and text files for data storage and retrieval.
The Java project called "Gym Management System" was created to help gym managers efficiently track their trainers, members, bookings, and machine inventory. It has a Command Line Interface (CLI) that makes it easy to perform different tasks.
